The site must be professional in appearance. One way to do this is using a bootstrap theme (which we recommend).

The site must be hosted online (e.g., via GitHub pages).
The site must not have any broken content: images, links, videos, etc., incuding social icon links.
The site must include a résumé portion created in HTML (not as a PDF). This should be a useful resume with good information organized in an easy-to-access way. Useful information includes your education, work experience, skills, and possibly some awards or honors that distinguish you. You do not need to include your contact information unless you want to. The résumé content can appear in your professional pages or your scratch page, or both.

From-scratch page:
This page must be created from a blank HTML file.
It can be about anything. Pick a hobby, or a passion, or something that fascinates you.
It must include the following as a demonstration of your ability to write HTML and CSS:
An unordered list embedded in an ordered list (or the other way around)
At least one image not from the Bootstrap theme (feel free to have many more)
An embedded YouTube video (we intentionally didn’t teach you this, so you would have to figure it out—good learning experience)
An on-page anchor
A custom background color or background image
You also need to link to (and apply) a stylesheet that you have created from scratch. This stylesheet should include:
At least four style definitions (it is possible you will have many more than four styles)
Styles that specify font color
Styles that specify font family
At least three divs for positioning and styling blocks of content in the HTML page
A live and interactive embedded Tableau graph (not just a picture of one).
This graph can be about anything. It doesn’t have to be a graph you created, although it certainly can be.
A quick Google search will show you where to find cool Tableau visualizations.
Navigation back to the professional-looking pages.

Your professional-looking pages do not need to link to the scratch page (but you will submit the URL to your scratch page). This way you can use the professional side for whatever you want without worrying someone might find this scratch page…
